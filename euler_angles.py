        if we have 2D - 3D correspondences & internsic camera matrix,

        this extrensic matrix is considered as the 3 eular angles & translation vector

        we can do that because the faces have similar 3D structure and emotions & iluminations dosn't affect the pose

            we can choose get any 3D coord from any 3D face model .. changing translation will not affect the angle
